<p style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: x-large;">RmKV began business operations initially as a small scale business enterprise at Turunelveli in 1924.[4] The company was named as RmKV in honor of its founding father Rm K Visvanatha Pillai by using initials mentioned on his birth certificate.[5]

The company made rapid strides by incorporating handloom silk weaving techniques to design and produce different types of sarees considering the evolution of the demographic aspects of women.[5] The company also introduced natural silk saree which was a predominant product sold by RmKV Silks to their customer base. RmKV also initiated a French tapestry technique in their weaving method to replicate Raja Ravi Varma paintings on the saree designs.[4] RmKV Silks also gained patent rights for its innovative novelty of lino silk saris, which weighs around 40% comparatively lesser than traditional silk sarees in general.</p>
